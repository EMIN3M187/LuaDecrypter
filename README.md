LuaDecrypter
============

The leading (and only) Garry's Mod clientside cache decompressor.

It decompresses Garry's LZMA compression on clientside/shared lua cache files found in garrysmod/cache/lua.

This includes and is not limited to:
*Most SWEPs
*All UI/HUD elements
*Basically anything that shows something on your monitor (I.e. shitty pointshop skins)
